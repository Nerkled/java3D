Simple 3D render engine in java

## Key Concepts

### Rasterization
Rasterization is the process of converting geometric primitives (such as points, lines, and polygons) into a raster image. In the context of 3D rendering, it involves determining which pixels on the screen are covered by the primitives and assigning appropriate colors to those pixels.

### Rendering Pipeline
The rendering pipeline is a series of stages that a 3D graphics system goes through to transform 3D models into 2D images. It consists of stages such as vertex processing, primitive assembly, rasterization, and pixel shading. Each stage performs specific operations to ultimately produce the final rendered image.

### Light Direction
Light direction refers to the direction from which light is coming in a 3D scene. It plays a crucial role in determining how objects are illuminated and shaded. By controlling the direction of light, you can create different lighting effects and enhance the realism of your 3D renderings.

For more detailed information on these concepts and how they relate to the java3D render engine, please refer to the documentation or the relevant sections in the code.
